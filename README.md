project for UCBX

This project is an example of a hand-crafted Spring MVC architecture with HSQL backing.

The idea is to serve a webapp that displays a random list of songs from the database.

The songs can be individually removed from the list and a new random one will replace the removed song.

The songs have meta data which will be displayed and can be edited.

The song list can be refreshed.  A new random list will replace the old list.
